## User-Story
AS A social media company
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance-Criteria 
GIVEN a social network API
  WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
  WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
  THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
  WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
  
## Installation 
To use this application, simply clone the repository to your local device then run npm i to install the necessary dependencies. 

## Usage
Run npm start to begin your server, it will then run on the defined port. As there is not yet an interface for this application, Insomnia or another similar application will be necessary to use it.
